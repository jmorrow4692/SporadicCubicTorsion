In these Sage computations, we actually work with the modular curve $X_{\mu}(N)$ (and its quotients) rather than $X_1(N)$. 

Note that there is an isomorphism $X_{\mu}(N) \to X_1(N)$ that sends the cusps to the cusps; isomorphism is $(E,f: \mu_N -> E[N]) to (E/im(f),f^{\vee}: Z/NZ -> E[N]/im(f))$. 

The reason for working with $X_{\mu}(N)$ rather than $X_1(N)$ is that when using the model $X_{\mu}(N)$ the cusp $\infty$ in $\H^*$ becomes rational, and hence many computations become easier.

We also note that the isomorphism $X_{\mu}(N) \to X_1(N)$ does not preserve Hecke operators, and so we use the Hecke operators $T_q - \langle q \rangle - q$ to kill the prime to $q$ torsion in $J_{\mu}(N)(\Q)$ (cf.~\cite[page 87]{DiamondIm:ModularCurves}).
