Here is code verifying the computations and theorems of the manuscript 

                                          "Sporadic Cubic Torsion"

There are 3 folders in this repository. One corresponding to each computer algebra program we use: Magma, Sage, and Maple.

In order to utilize this code, one needs to do the following first:

0. Upload the Magma files (The two latter .m files come Ozman--Siksek "Quadratic points on modular curves")
  - functions.m
  - modEqns.m 
  - quadPts.m 

1. Upload the following Python files from the folder mdsage (These files come from Maarten Derickx's Github https://koffie.github.io/mdsage/doc/html/index.html)
  - cuspidal_classgroup.py
  - maartens_sage_functions.py
  - modular_unit_divisors.py
(Alternatively, one could download the .zip file mdsage.zip and unzip this in your local directory).

Once the above files are loaded, you will be able to run the below code verifying claims found in our paper.

The Magma code verifying the ranks of modular Jacobians computations from Section 3 can be found at master-ranks.m

The Sage code verifying the cuspidal torsion computations from Section 4 can be found at torsionComputations.py

For each specific case, Magma code verifiying the claims in the paper can be found at master-N.m (E.g., master-22.m corresponds to code verifying the case of X1(22))

In the Maple folder, one can find the following:
  - Cuspidal_part_of_J1N_output (Output of algorithm CuspidalClassGroupStructure from http://www.math.fsu.edu/~hoeij/files/X1N/cusp_divisors_program which gives the     structure of the subgroup of J1(N) generated by the Galois orbits of cusps for N <= 100.)
  - FindModel_XH_45_output (Gives a singular model for the modular curve XH(45) from Subsection 6.7)
  - Lift_XY_back_to_X1_45_output (Gives a way to lift a cubic point on XH(45) back to X1(45) to check whether it gives a cubic point on X1(45))
