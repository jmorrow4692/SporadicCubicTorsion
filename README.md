There are 3 folders in this repository. One corresponding to each computer algebra program we use: Magma, Sage, and Maple.

In order to utilize this code, one needs to do the following:

0. Download the following Magma files (The two latter .m files come Ozman--Siksek "Quadratic points on modular curves" https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08192)
    - functions.m
    - modEqns.m 
    - quadPts.m 

1. Download the following Python files (These files come from Maarten Derickx's Github https://koffie.github.io/mdsage/doc/html/index.html)
   - cuspidal_classgroup.py
   - maartens_sage_functions.py
   - modular_unit_divisors.py

Once the above files are loaded, you will be able to run the below code verifying claims found in our paper.

In the Magma folder, one finds:
   - master-ranks.m (Magma code verifying the ranks of modular Jacobians computations from Section 3)
   - master-N.m (Magma code for the computations in Sections 6 and 7 of the paper can be found at. For example, the file master-22.m corresponds to code verifying       the case of X1(22)).
   - ModelForXH45.txt (A text file with the model for the modular curve XH(45) from Subsection 6.7 and a way to lift a cubic point on XH(45) back to X1(45))

In the Sage folder, one finds:
  - torsionComputations.py (Sage code verifying the cuspidal torsion computations from Section 4).
  
In the Maple folder, one finds:
  - Cuspidal_part_of_J1N_output (Output of algorithm CuspidalClassGroupStructure from http://www.math.fsu.edu/~hoeij/files/X1N/cusp_divisors_program which gives the     structure of the subgroup of J1(N) generated by the Galois orbits of cusps)
  - FindModel_XH_45_output (Gives a singular model for the modular curve XH(45) from Subsection 6.7)
  - Lift_XY_back_to_X1_45_output (Gives a way to lift a cubic point on XH(45) back to X1(45) to check whether it gives a cubic point on X1(45))
  - Additionally, the input files of these.
